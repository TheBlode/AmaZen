# AmaZen
Are you sick of being bombarded with ads while browsing on Amazon? Me too. That's why I wrote this Chrome Extension! This Extension will hide a lot of the advertisements and invasive elements on Amazon listings to allow you to create a focused shopping experience showing you only the most pertinent information; product information and product reviews. I hope you find this Extension useful!

# Installation
- Clone the repository using `git`, Github Desktop or download the repository as a zip file.
- Extract zip contents to a local folder on your computer.
- Open up Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions (or navigate to the extensions page through the File menu).
- Enable `Developer Mode`.
- Click `Load Unpacked Extension`.
- Select the `Chrome Extension` folder.

And you're done! You can open up the extension options by clicking the puzzle piece icon and clicking the love heart with a magnifying glass icon. Enjoy!
